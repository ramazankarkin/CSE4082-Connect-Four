# CSE4082-Connect-Four
Second project of CSE4082
In this project, We are going to implement the Connect-Four game and an AI
player for this game.
We should implement a fully functioning game (text-based interface can be
used) that can be played by:
- a human player vs a human player,
- a human player vs the AI player,
- AI player vs AI player.
